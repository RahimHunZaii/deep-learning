## Introduction

This project aims to provide clear implementations and explanations of ANN and CNN architectures. It includes practical examples, datasets, and visualization tools to help users understand how these models work.

## Models

### Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

ANNs are computational models inspired by the human brain. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers. ANNs can learn complex patterns and are widely used for various tasks, including regression and classification.

#### Key Features:
- Flexible architecture (can be adjusted to various tasks)
- Capable of handling non-linear relationships
- Suitable for structured data

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

CNNs are a specialized type of neural network designed for processing structured grid data, such as images. They use convolutional layers to automatically detect patterns and features, making them highly effective for tasks like image classification and object detection.

#### Key Features:
- Automatic feature extraction
- Translation invariance (works well with shifted data)
- Suitable for image and spatial data
